# Predict Consumer Electronics Sales Dataset- Feature Engineering & EDA & ML Modeling

**Description :** Here I worked on a data study of customers' purchase intentions for electronic products and developed a model for their prediction.

**Dataset Content:**<br>
This dataset provides information on consumer electronics sales, including product categories, brands, prices, customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and satisfaction metrics. It aims to analyze the factors influencing purchase intentions and customer satisfaction in the consumer electronics market.

**Dataset Features:**<br>
**ProductID:** Unique identifier for each product. <br>
**ProductCategory:** Category of consumer electronics products (e.g., Smartphones, Laptops).<br>
**ProductBrand:** Brand of the products (e.g., Apple, Samsung).<br>
**ProductPrice:** Selling price of the products ($).<br>
**CustomerAge:** Age of the customers.<br>
**CustomerGender:** Gender of the customers (0 - Male, 1 - Female).<br>
**PurchaseFrequency:** Average number of purchases per year.<br>
**CustomerSatisfaction:** Customer satisfaction ratings (1 - 5).<br>
**PurchaseIntent (Target Variable):** Purchase intention.<br>

*I derived new variables by extracting some new features from the raw data in the dataset, which allowed my model to run with a higher success rate*
